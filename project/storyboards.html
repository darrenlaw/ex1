        <p class="essay">Creating these storyboards made me think about how I see my project being used. It gave me visual feedback to what I'm missing and qualities that were new to me. Having feedback from other people helped me get information I didn't know I needed as well as ideas on how to push my project. It also gave me a reason/challenge to explain what my project actually is and how to describe it verbally. I also learned that some people are in the same boat as me, not sure what we're really doing.</p>
