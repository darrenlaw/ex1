            <li>Learn the content through the story, the dialogue, the illustrations. Once they dive deeper into the game, they should be able to understand what the point of the game is. </li>

            <li>Primary objectives will be displayed on the screen. As well as tutorials throughout. It's is also subconciously as they play the game and learn.</li>

            <li>Content? They'll have to know have to read. ._. They'll have to understand the concept of a basic scary game. Maybe some basic art knowledge? (I'll probably use a simpler language though.)</li>

            <li>Since it's a browser game, I would want them to experience a game that doesn't need tons of people/funding to create. It could inspire them to create their own since they will also learn drawing/art techniques.</li>
