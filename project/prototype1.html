        <p class="sidetext">It was an interesting experience drawing up the navigation/basic look of my game, but there was a lot I didn't know how to translate into a black and white form, so I think it made it difficult for my partner to experience. Stuff like an item with a white halo around it to indicate that it should be hovered/click on. After the initial testing, I found that my navigation needs to be more prominent because my partner kept pressing on the dialogue box, thinking it was a link (probably because I wrote "explore" in it, so that was also confusing). I also realized how much I am trying to do within the couple of weeks we have left. (I have to draw A LOT of things within the next week so I can code everything.) That... is... so... exciting. ._. I may have to simplify some things to make it easier on myself, as well as the player. Also, I don't have a finalized storyboard/map of my game or that some pages/overlays are similar, but I put in the key aspects.
