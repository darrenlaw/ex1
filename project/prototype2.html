        <p class="sidetext">I was a lot more thourough this time with the prototype! I included the some more "maps" and clearer navigation. I still had a problem depicting the actual navigation of my game, so I used buttons/circles (which will not be in the final version). It was helpful having a more complete prototype so that my partner can get a clear sense of my game. Making each card made me think about the mapping of my sight AND HOW COMPLICATED I'M MAKING THIS. "I really hope I'll be able to finish this in time" is what was running through my mind. This definitely helped in planning the game though. I know where to put everything and  the general layout of the game. I feel like I had to explain a little more than last time, but that may be caused by the experience from prototype #1. It would have taken forever for my partner to go through the game if I didn't explain the context of it, which is why I am adding an "about the game" option in the main menu.
