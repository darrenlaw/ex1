				<p> An interface I love to use is from the ArtStation website. ArtStation is a form of social media that illustrators use to showcase their work. It is somewhat like a portfolio. What I love about it is the way in which they preview each artwork. The thumbnails are large enough to get a good look at each piece. They also let the artists choose what they want to showcase in the thumbnail. There are also icons that indicate if there are multiple files within the preview, as well as a program that allows 3D modelers to showcase the entire model, which allows the viewer to rotate the 3D model in every angle. When you do click on an image, the image is shown as large as possible, showing every detail and etc. The website is an easy way to look at a lot of professional artists' works and lets companies check out potential employees. It's definitely similar to DeviantArt, but in a more professional fashion. The colors and spot colors are very professional and it makes me feel all adult-like using it. The website is also responsive and looks just as amazing when you shrink the window. You can check out ArtStation <a href = "https://www.artstation.com/">here</a>.</p><br>
